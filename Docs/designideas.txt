objects/components that generally need to always exist (sound managers, scene managers, state managers, etc) should be on DoNotDestroy in the init scene

there should be a playermanager that handles movement, object instantiation, switching between scenes, etc.

create an object (manager?) in each scene that keeps track of the state of that particular scene (initializing positions, saving states, etc)
