CURRENT GOALS
add a text box for the player to read when interacting with stuff. 
- make it so all control is ceded to the text box when in that state.


TODO
make sprite with directionality (faces a direction)
make sprite capable of interacting with objects with "A"

try to create a custom voxel that encapsulates a 3d object.
- use an existing prefab
- this will make loading/unloading things easier.

make it possible to see through walls when the player is behind it

make the game playable with a controller
- should learn about the new input system for this
can potentially use voxel play's input system for this

make it possible to move in any direction with "snapping" to the grid, like fire emblem awakening and pokemon ORAS

animate the player

make slopes occlude their surroundings

add combat

add dialog

add a "detatched mode" like advance wars/divinity, where the sprite stays put and a cursor appears that can move around.
this can look around, build things, select things, etc.
maybe shouldn't load things past the sprite's vision.

guide the camera in scenarios where it would be nice to do so, like if the player was descending a spiral staircase against a wall

break rotation and movement into its own classes

add shadows to sprites?

think about design of sprites. can I afford to have 4 directions per sprite? Maybe
a side profile + running + attacking is enough
- player can be special. Can have 4 directions for the player classes + potential customizability (hair, armor, etc like fire emblem),
  and NPCs/monsters just have 2 idle sprites and an attack sprite like rift wizard


STYLE IMPROVEMENTS
- dialog box
- 

DISCUSSION
- the issue with this approach is it requires at least 4 sprites just for being able to stand in a direction.
- it'd be weird if the player had all these animations but the NPCS/monsters did not
- instead, a less resource intensive way might be to have the sprite glide above the terrain, and have an A button
become available when they are close enough to talk. this would reduce the number of sprites needed to 2. One would
be for standing, one would be for walking, and directionality can be achieved with flipping the sprite.
- I think with this interaction system, a movement system that's less coupled to the grid would be ideal, although I could see
a system where the player is still on the grid but must stand next to the NPC to talk working, kind of like early Pokemon.
- a grid-based movement system appeals to my nostalgia and is actually convenient sometimes when navigating terrain, but
a free movement system is more natural.
- decided a left/right profile with a minimal walking animation is the least resource intensive way to do this that still stays
true to the 2d/3d aesthetic and has directionality/movement.


BUGS TO FIX
fix texture issues on slopes

MVP FOR FRIEND
- needs to have some fun-looking environments (can use art from this creator - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/retro-dungeons-modular-house-interiors-170705)
	I'm thinking at least a home, a village-y area, and "dungeon" area
- needs to have at least two classes the player can choose from, one martial and one magic
- needs at least two fights
- need to demonstrate somehow that the player can modify the terrain to their liking
- needs an NPC or a monster who joins the player
- needs some dialog that showcases a little story

- should really be playable with a controller
- would be nice if a movement option became available for the player early on (like a bike that can ride around a generated area)
- would be nice to have the player able to customize the look of their character

DONE
add player movement
- need to move the existing camera to above the sprite, and add controls that cause the sprite to move
- the existing camera must be used because it determines what voxels are loaded
- need to be able to switch between hovering above the sprite and walking around in first-person
-

make movement linear (move 1 unit every 0.X seconds, linearly. transform.lerp)

hide the cursor when in top-down mode

create a custom voxel for slopes
- useful for allowing players to travel up or down a level. necessary for interesting levels
- required using unity probuilder to create the mesh

block player movement into spaces occupied by voxels
- need to answer questions: what cube is the sprite occupying? what cube is the sprite entering? is that cube occupied?

need to prevent slope voxel from telling the engine it can occlude the wall

automatically move the player upwards/downwards on slopes
- need to just move them up/down now

restrict movement to grounded movement

allow the camera to move through walls in sprite mode

allow the player to rotate the camera
- current system assumes always facing front

add NPCs
- have my own "move sprite" method that handles moving around the player and NPCs
- make them not move into other creature-occupied tiles or voxel occupied tiles
- have all sprites obey rules of movement, including NPCs (can go up/down slopes)
- fix rotation for NPCs
