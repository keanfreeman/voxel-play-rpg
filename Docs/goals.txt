CURRENT GOALS

TODO
try to create a custom voxel that encapsulates a 3d object.
- use an existing prefab
- this will make loading/unloading things easier.

make it possible to see through walls when the player is behind it

make the game playable with a controller
- should learn about the new input system for this
can potentially use voxel play's input system for this

make it possible to move in any direction with "snapping" to the grid, like fire emblem awakening and pokemon ORAS

animate the player

make slopes occlude their surroundings

add combat

add dialog

add a "detatched mode" like advance wars/divinity, where the sprite stays put and a cursor appears that can move around.
this can look around, build things, select things, etc.
maybe shouldn't load things past the sprite's vision.

guide the camera in scenarios where it would be nice to do so, like if the player was descending a spiral staircase against a wall

break rotation and movement into its own classes

add shadows to sprites?


BUGS TO FIX
fix texture issues on slopes

DONE
add player movement
- need to move the existing camera to above the sprite, and add controls that cause the sprite to move
- the existing camera must be used because it determines what voxels are loaded
- need to be able to switch between hovering above the sprite and walking around in first-person
-

make movement linear (move 1 unit every 0.X seconds, linearly. transform.lerp)

hide the cursor when in top-down mode

create a custom voxel for slopes
- useful for allowing players to travel up or down a level. necessary for interesting levels
- required using unity probuilder to create the mesh

block player movement into spaces occupied by voxels
- need to answer questions: what cube is the sprite occupying? what cube is the sprite entering? is that cube occupied?

need to prevent slope voxel from telling the engine it can occlude the wall

automatically move the player upwards/downwards on slopes
- need to just move them up/down now

restrict movement to grounded movement

allow the camera to move through walls in sprite mode

allow the player to rotate the camera
- current system assumes always facing front

add NPCs
- have my own "move sprite" method that handles moving around the player and NPCs
- make them not move into other creature-occupied tiles or voxel occupied tiles
- have all sprites obey rules of movement, including NPCs (can go up/down slopes)
