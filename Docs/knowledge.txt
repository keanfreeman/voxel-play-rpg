the player exists on the square above the slope

issue - the character controller is integral to the way the first-person movement works, but it causes collisions in the other mode
- can remedy this by destroying the controller and recreating it, then refreshing with checkcharactercontroller
- can also change the class to not be so dependent on the character controller
- I think in the long-term, due to the need for 3 basic modes (1st person, 3rd person, and disembodied/edit mode) and voxel play's 
	lack of controller support, I will need my own 1st person camera with many of voxel play's features. but I don't want to get bogged
	down in that yet.
