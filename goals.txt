CURRENT GOAL
automatically move the player upwards/downwards on slopes

TODO
try to create a custom voxel that encapsulates a 3d object.
- use an existing prefab
- this will make loading/unloading things easier.

make it possible to see through walls when the player is behind it

make the game playable with a controller
- should learn about the new input system for this

make it possible to move in any direction with "snapping" to the grid, like fire emblem awakening and pokemon ORAS

animate the player

DONE
add player movement
- need to move the existing camera to above the sprite, and add controls that cause the sprite to move
- the existing camera must be used because it determines what voxels are loaded
- need to be able to switch between hovering above the sprite and walking around in first-person
-

make movement linear (move 1 unit every 0.X seconds, linearly. transform.lerp)

hide the cursor when in top-down mode

create a custom voxel for slopes
- useful for allowing players to travel up or down a level. necessary for interesting levels
- required using unity probuilder to create the mesh

block player movement into spaces occupied by voxels
- need to answer questions: what cube is the sprite occupying? what cube is the sprite entering? is that cube occupied?
