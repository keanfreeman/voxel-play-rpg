current goal - make movement linear (move 1 unit every 0.X seconds, linearly. transform.lerp)


add player movement
- need to move the existing camera to above the sprite, and add controls that cause the sprite to move
- the existing camera must be used because it determines what voxels are loaded
- need to be able to switch between hovering above the sprite and walking around in first-person
-

create a custom voxel for slopes
- useful for allowing players to travel up or down a level. necessary for interesting levels

try to create a custom voxel that encapsulates a 3d object.
- use an existing prefab
- this will make loading/unloading things easier.
