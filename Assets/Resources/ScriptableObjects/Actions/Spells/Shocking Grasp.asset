  description: "Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature
    you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage
    on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the
    target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can\u2019t take reactions until the
    start of its next turn. The spell\u2019s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach
    5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8)."
