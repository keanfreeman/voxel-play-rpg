  description: "A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand.
    Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect.
    Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order
    of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that
    can\u2019t see). Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points,
    each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the spell ends. Subtract
    each creature\u2019s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature
    with the next lowest hit points. A creature\u2019s hit points must be equal to
    or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. At Higher
    Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll
    an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st."
