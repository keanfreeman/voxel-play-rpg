  description: "This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the
    total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within
    20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of
    their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures). Starting with the
    creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this
    spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone
    uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature\u2019s
    hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest
    hit points. A creature\u2019s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining
    total for that creature to be affected. Undead and creatures immune to being
    charmed aren\u2019t affected by this spell. At Higher Levels. When you cast this
    spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each
    slot level above 1st."
