  description: "You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying
    your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended
    spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal
    to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can
    be 6th level or higher. For example, if you\u2019re a 4th-level wizard, you can
    recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level
    spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots."
