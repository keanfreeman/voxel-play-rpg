  description: "Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit
    a foe\u2019s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to
    one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll.
    The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don\u2019t need advantage
    on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that
    enemy isn\u2019t incapacitated, and you don\u2019t have disadvantage on the attack
    roll. The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class,
    as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table."
