Now that everyone's here, let's get started.
Haul, one of our beloved miners, hasn't been seen since last night. The entrance to the mine appears to have collapsed shut.
Any questions? -> loop_knot

* [Are the mines dangerous?]
    They're no walk in the park. I've had enough run-ins with blood-sucking bats and disembodied hands for a lifetime.
    Still, it's nothing Haul couldn't handle. Usually. -> loop_knot
* [How concerned should we be?]
    I'm not saying to expect the worst, but I think we should get in there and make sure she's okay.
    And my gut says we haven't got forever. -> loop_knot
* [Is everyone prepared?]
    I think so. I've got a set of construction tools, so we can dig our way in. Grimes, Drill and I have our armor and weapons.
    If you've got your fancy wizard spells ready, we can go. -> loop_knot
* [Let's go find Haul!]
    -> complete_knot

== complete_knot ==
Good. Let's form a search party, open up the mine, and see what's in there. -> END
